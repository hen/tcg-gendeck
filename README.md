# tcg-gendeck

This generates the following pages:

1) A page that generates a random 3xW3/3xW4 pull for creating a Limited deck for the Energon Invitational: https://hen.github.io/tcg-gendeck/generate-limited.html
2) A page that generates a random 2-booster pull for a Turbo match: https://hen.github.io/tcg-gendeck/generate-turbo.html
3) A page that selects random teams for a match, based on initial filters: https://hen.github.io/tcg-gendeck/pick-random.html

TODO: 

* Review the ratios; they're not complete right
* Move to a UI Framework; CSS is getting ugh
* Show stats for the deck (B, W, O, Bl)
* On-click, rotate through bot card images
