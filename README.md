# tcg-gendeck

This produces a web page that lets you generate a random Transformers TCG Wave 3 booster pack: https://hen.github.io/tcg-gendeck/generate-limited.html

TODO: 

* Add in other waves. A little code needs genericizing and ratios need estimating for the other waves.
* Set it up so it's easy to generate the 3xW3 + 3xW4 Limited decks for the Energon Invitational.
