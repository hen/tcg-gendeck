# tcg-gendeck

This produces a web page that generates a random 3xW3/3xW4 pull for creating a Limited deck for the Energon Invitational: https://hen.github.io/tcg-gendeck/ generate-limited.html

TODO: 

* Deal with the special logic for small bots in W3 and W4 so W1/W2 can be displayed.
* Extract to a .js library file
* Create a second page for generating Turbo matches
* Review the ratios; they're not complete right
* Move to a UI Framework; CSS is getting ugh
* Show stats for the deck (B, W, O, Bl)
